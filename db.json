It is the fraud that we are all engaged in, whether we like it or not. The world as we know it is ending. Climate change is real. But we have no idea what to do about it. We don’t know how this story ends.\n\nWe thought we were building the infrastructure for sharing knowledge and information, to educate the world and raise humanity out of poverty, disease, and war.\n\nInstead, the internet has become the vehicle for disinformation, poverty, disease, and war.\n\n# Think Like an Architect\n\nIf we are focused on the aesthetics and functionality of a particular user interface, then we are doing user interface design.\n\nIf we are focused on the human motivations, the technological capacity, and the business strategy of building tools, infrastructure, and architecture, then we are doing user experience design.\n\nWe need to think like architects about the social, economic, and political implications of what we are doing.\n\n- Social: does it meet a human need?\n- Economic: given what is possible, can we use the available time, energy, and resources to accomplish it?\n- Political: can we convince other people that it is important and valuable to invest in this course of action?\n\nThis is metaphysical design. These are the intangibles that we cannot reduce to measurements. We must decide what we value, and there is no physical, empirical methods for discovering these things, unless we reduce people to numbers, which is what capitalism does to humans. Humans are merely numbers on a balance sheet.\n\n---\n\n# Builders Collective\n\nExploring how we can imagine, design, and build the future together.

We use technology to solve problems, but these solutions often have unintended side-effects that result in seemingly intractable problems.\n\nThe concept of resilience begins with an assumption that things break, that things will go wrong, that conflicts and problems will arise. In response to this reality, we need to create ways of proactively addressing issues before they become intractable problems.\n\nSome of the greatest creative movements have coalesced during times of immense cultural shifts and of social, political and economic crisis. As we survey our current situation, we find the social fabric being torn apart and the institutions of government, law, media,  business, and education being threatened by the inability to quickly adapt to the changes that we ourselves are bringing about either intentionally or inadvertently.\n\nWe need people who can lead our society in a different direction, against the inertia of the status quo. This is a different kind of leadership that arises from the recognition that every individual has the ability to offer their time, energy, and resources to the effort.\n\nA century ago, a great war came to an end and people came together to try to rebuild society. It was an opportunity to envision something entirely new, a modern society built on the fusion of art, technology, and industry. Craftspeople, artists and architects gathered to reimagine the forms and structures of human society. By considering basic human needs of food, clothing, and shelter, they innovated a conception of the modern dwelling: how to build a house. From the hands of millions of workers has arisen the crystal symbol of a new faith, but with the destruction of that concrete, steel and glass symbol, disillusionment has engulfed the world, bringing into question all that has been accomplished.\n\nIt brings to mind an ancient myth about people of one language who came together to build a tower, but their language was confused and the people were scattered across the earth.\n\n## What are we building?\n\nThe question we are asking ourselves is whether all the time, energy, and resources that have been invested has been worth the effort if most of the profit is accumulated by a select few and at the expense of the natural world on which our lives depend. Have we architected the means of our own demise, socially, politically, economically and ecologically?\n\n## Reimagining our social architecture\n\nGiven the challenge our generation faces, we endeavour to invest time, energy and resources in the effort of building leaders to design a resilient society. By considering basic human needs of food, clothing, and shelter, we will innovate a conception of the modern dwelling: how to build a house. The difference now is greater self-awareness, a recognition of how things can go very wrong, and the technological means to create virtual models with predictive power to anticipate problems before they become reality. This is a collaborative project to better understand ourselves and our place in this world, to find generative ways to live with each other and the natural world.\n\nTranscending human-centered design, this is design that seeks to learn from nature, to put into practice the knowledge and principles of biomimicry to reimagine and redesign our environment, to reconnect ourselves to our own humanity and to reconnect us to the earth and all living things."},{"url":"/process/","title":"To Build","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"To Build","url":"/process/"}],"content":"\n# Social Architecture\n\n## We Are All Designers\n\nAs humans, we are makers. We wield tools to transform our environment. We have collectively designed global systems of social, economic, and political power by our labour and participation in the ideas, work, and the processes, tools, machines, infrastructure, and architecture that enable these systems and activities.\n\nHowever, after working intensively for the past century, based on a modern idea of progress that values efficiency and productivity as a means of creating continuous and limitless economic growth, we have set in motion systems that are resulting in the destruction of the biological support systems on which our lives and those of so many other creatures depend.\n\n## Slowing Down to Think\n\nGiven the unintended consequences of the social architecture that we have imagined, designed, and built, we recognize that there is a need to slow down to think about the values that are driving our work. We are finding that we have designed our lives in such a way that we are serving our corporations and our machines more than we are serving the needs of humans. We are serving abstract ideas and inanimate objects while destroying life.\n\n## The Design Process\n\nThe process of design has proven to be extremely effective in creating the modern world. We have discovered the tools to radically transform the physical environment. At the same time, we have fundamentally transformed ourselves as human beings, both for good and for ill.\n\nOver the past century, we have focused on building our physical infrastructure, creating a social architecture that has solidified habits of thought, work, and social organization into forms that further entrench patterns of behaviour in social, economic, and political systems that are ultimately self-destructive.\n\nThis is a moment of realization and awareness that is motivating people to respond in anxiety, grief, and anger toward the grave circumstances in which we find ourselves. However, this is not the end of the story. We also have the means and ability to change the way we live. We can recognize the vast opportunities that this world affords and imagine the possibilities, research and define the challenges to be solved, design solutions to meet these needs, and build the kind of future in which we might all want to live.\n\nLet us now focus on the metaphysical—that which is beyond the physical: the social, economic, and political. We tend to lack the language to converse about the metaphysical, since the modern approach to social communication focuses on advertising and marketing to maintain our economic system, and, as a result, tends to create a monopoly on the mode of public and civic discourse.\n\nHowever, the technology of the modern world also gives us the means to shift the focus toward more democratic and equitable modes of conversation and engagement. Our ability to share ideas, resources, and efforts has been amplified by our technologies. We must begin with common values and the common good to redirect our time, energy, and resources into the work of reimagining, redesigning, and rebuilding our social architecture."},{"url":"/community/","title":"Community","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Community","url":"/community/"}],"content":"\n# A Community\n\n## Engaging in authentic human connection to build community\n\nBy listening to the voices of the marginalized and the disenfranchised, one encounters people going through a process of coming to terms with their own identity. The recurring themes involve words like power, hierarchies, assumptions, questions, disillusionment, work, displacement, precariousness, insecurity, fear, disconnection, assimilation, deconstruction, reconstruction and reconnection.\n\nTechnologies are bridging the geographical distances as well as the emotional distances. Connections are beginning to form across the divides that have kept people separate and siloed.\n\nOur identities are formed by a complex network of interdependent relationships that begin with our origins as the reproductive biological function of the union of two people to form a new member of the human species.\n\nWe tend to accept the social situations in which we find ourselves as monolithic and unchangeable.

Of the nearly 20,000 mining projects in the world from Africa to Latin America, more than half are Canadian operated. Not only does the mining economy employ close to 400,000 people in Canada, it contributed $57 billion CAD to Canada's GDP in 2014 alone. Globally, more than 75 percent of the world's mining firms are based in Canada. The scale of these statistics naturally extends the logic of Canada's historical legacy as state, nation, and now as global resource empire. Canada, once a far-flung northern outpost of the British Empire, has become an empire in its own right.”\n\n“This book examines both the historic and contemporary Canadian culture of extraction, with essays, interviews, archival material, and multimedia visualizations. The essayists and interviewees—who include such prominent figures as Naomi Klein and Michael Ignatieff—come from a range of fields, including geography, art, literature, architecture, science, environment, and business. All consider how Canadian life came to be mediated through mineral extraction. When did this empire emerge? How far does it reach? Who gains, who loses? What alternatives exist? On the 150th anniversary of the creation of Canada by Queen Victoria's Declaration of Confederation, it is time for Canada to reexamine and reimagine its imperial role throughout the world, from coast to coast, from one continent to another.”\n\nhttps://mitpress.mit.edu/books/extraction-empire\n\n### Mining\n\nMining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth, usually from an ore body, lode, vein, seam, reef or placer deposit. These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.\n\nOres recovered by mining include metals, coal, oil shale, gemstones, limestone, chalk, dimension stone, rock salt, potash, gravel, and clay. Mining is required to obtain any material that cannot be grown through agricultural processes, or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.\n\nMining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times. Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies, analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine, extraction of the desired materials, and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed.\n\nMining operations usually create a negative environmental impact, both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed. Hence, most of the world's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact. Work safety has long been a concern as well, and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines.\n\nLevels of metal recycling are generally low. Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up, some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products. Due to the low recycling rates, some landfills now contain higher concentrations of metal than mines themselves.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining\n\n### Extraction of Petroleum\n\nThe oil and gas extraction workforce face unique health and safety challenges and is recognized by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues. During 2003–2013, the annual rate of occupational fatalities significantly decreased 36.3%; however, the number of work-related fatalities in the U.S. oil and gas extraction industry increased 27.6%, with a total of 1,189 deaths because the size of the workforce grew during this period. Two-thirds of all worker fatalities were attributed to transportation incidents and contact with objects or equipment. More than 50% of persons fatally injured were employed by companies that service wells. Hazard controls include land transportation safety policies and engineering controls such as automated technologies.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraction_of_petroleum\n\n---\n\n## The Canadian Genocide\n\n### Papal Law\n\nCanada, the BC Government, the RCMP, and Coastal GasLink are implementing industrial-scale assimilation by imposing band councils as “electoral democracy” to erase claims of Indigenous Rights and Title to sovereign territory.\n\nhttps://upstanderproject.org/firstlight/doctrine\n\n---\n\n“Canada is violating international laws around military occupation and the rights of Indigenous people.

Rather we react and behave emotionally and invent rationalizations to justify our instinctive and impulsive actions.\n\nValues, perceptions, narratives, and social identities are far more compelling than data, facts, information, and rational thought in the way that we understand our environment and make decisions as social creatures.\n\n![Diagram of the Bauhaus curriculum](https://d3vjn2zm46gms2.cloudfront.net/blogs/2019/09/18133749/gri_850513_b001_f003_recto_376388ds_1600-1300x873.jpg)\n\n[Diagram of the Bauhaus curriculum](https://blogs.getty.edu/iris/developing-an-inner-feeling-for-materials-with-paper-modeling-at-the-bauhaus/) (adapted, right), 1922, Walter Gropius.

There is an interesting, rather mysterious connection that I have observed between experience and reality. That is, we can conceive of ideas beyond what we sense in the physical environment that are ideals or concepts that can never exist in reality. The ideas are beyond the physical, or metaphysical.\n\nThe other curious characteristic of these ideas is that they occur in groups of three, both in the physical and the metaphysical. Humans have a curious affinity for the rule of thirds, not just in the aesthetics of art, but in all of life.\n\nOn the other hand, there seems to be a relationship between the ideals that we can conceive of and the imperfect realities within which we exist. In that sense, it is possible to conjecture that the physical is a metaphor for the metaphysical, or vice versa.\n\n![Three: progress and the evolution of ideas](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49243812022_3ff2b852ba_b.jpg)\n\n# Mental Models\n\nA mental model is what a person believes about experience and reality.\nIn user experience design, a mental model is what the user believes about the system at hand.\n\nMental models are in flux exactly because they’re embedded in a brain rather than fixed in an external medium. Additional experience with the system can obviously change the model, but users might also update their mental models based on stimuli from elsewhere, such as talking to other users or even applying lessons from other systems.\n\n# Story 1: Collaboration\n\nHow, then, can we begin to map the human experience? How we can design mental habits, social systems, and physical environments for resilience and symbiosis with the living processes and ecology that are the foundation of our biological support systems?\n\nTo better understand our materials as experience designers, we need more holistic mental models of the human experience, as a way to understand what we are designing for.\n\n[![A mental model: builder](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49234429626_7a6763a44b_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/2i1FjCj)\n\n[![A mental model worksheet: builder](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49236449251_1caaf6d94c_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/2i1REZr)\n\n## Unintended Consequences\n\nThe design profession is currently facing a reckoning, similar to the revolutions in our understanding of class, race, gender, and religion. The 1700-year-old project of cultural imperialism that originated with the Roman Emperor Constantine and the integration of church and state finds its realization in the social, political, and economic institutions that have created monolithic monopolies of global power.\n\nThe unintended consequences of the tools that we have designed to shape our environment are the weaponizing of those tools as the means for controlling and manipulating populations, protecting access to scarce resources, and eliminating threats to religious, national, and corporate prosperity and security.\n\n### A healthy economy should be designed to thrive, not grow\n\n<div style=\"max-width:854px\"><div style=\"position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/kate_raworth_a_healthy_economy_should_be_designed_to_thrive_not_grow\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" style=\"position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>\n\n### Kate Raworth argues that rethinking economics can save our planet\n\n<div style=\"max-width:854px\"><div style=\"position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/the_ted_interview_kate_raworth_argues_that_rethinking_economics_can_save_our_planet\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" style=\"position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>\n\n# Story 2: Competition\n\nThe primitive limbic systems in our brains are designed to trigger the fight or flight response as a matter of survival in a world of physical threats. Senses are attuned to dangers in the environment and events perceived as threats will automatically trigger a physical and biological response of increased heart rate, a release of adrenalin, and a heightened state of awareness, along with emotions of anxiety, fear, and panic.\n\nWhen this intellectual, emotional, and physical state of anxiety is prolonged, we call this stress. People who live in this constant state of fear and scarcity will tend to engage in behaviours that are focused on survival and self-preservation. This interpretation of constant threat leads to isolation and aggression, as members of a group engage in a competition for scarce resources and demonstrations of strength and dominance to control the group, protect resources, and destroy enemies. However, such isolation and aggression has a tendency to undermine the survival of the group.\n\n### An Argument for Cooperation Over Competition\n\n<div style=\"max-width:854px\"><div style=\"position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/nick_hanauer_the_dirty_secret_of_capitalism_and_a_new_way_forward\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" style=\"position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>\n\n[![A mental model: nation](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49236656232_0e5406ab4c_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/2i1SJw5)\n\n[![A mental model worksheet: nation](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49235974428_1caaf6d94c_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/2i1PeQQ)\n\n# Metaphysical Design\n\n## Shaping our Social, Economic, and Political Environments\n\nLacking a science that helps us to conceive of a person holistically, it may be possible to draw from the observations of the generations of people who have come before us. They formulated conceptions and philosophies of the world that attempt to communicate the complex, interconnected relationships of human beings to their physical and metaphysical environments. There are things that humans experience that are distinctly tangible, but others that we cannot measure, test, or account for through physical means. Should we simply ignore this data, that which is beyond physical or empirical measurement, or is there something to be gleaned from the musings, conjectures, observations, histories, and literature preserved in ancient sacred texts?\n\n# Story 3: Utopia\n\nAnother mental model acknowledges a common conception of the trinitarian God popularized by the Western Christian colonization of the globe. It represents a mental model of the Creator. The book of Genesis asserts that humans have been made in God’s image. This mental model represents the human mind, heart, and body as a reflection of the trinitarian nature of the Christian conception of the divine as Father, Spirit, and Son. This model captures some common conceptions of the perfection to which humans aspire, but from which we fall short. In many ways, our societies, corporations, and nations are attempts at social, economic, and political utopian visions that fall short of the ideologies and narratives that we have formulated to rationalize our attempts to create a better world.\n\n[![A mental model: creator](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49236656267_bcdfdd1b0d_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/2i1SJwF)\n\n[![A mental model worksheet: creator](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49236449221_6c34e90c05_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/2i1REYV)\n\n# Story 4: Choose Your Own Adventure\n\nBy inviting people to participate in design workshops using these worksheets, we can explore the theme of **design for resilience**.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what is wrong with our existing systems. They are very poorly conceived, designed, and built. However, the blanks in the model actually tell us how much agency we have in this reality. There are a lot of things that are givens, but we have a lot of freedom. Where we lose freedom is in the choices we make collectively. We have designed our own hell in the form of social, economic, and political systems that manifest as physical products, infrastructure, and architecture.\n\nHow might we design a world where we can all live together without killing each other and undermining the life support systems of the planet?\n\nSaul Griffith shares some interesting ideas in his discussion with Ezra Klein: [How to solve climate change and make life more awesome](https://player.fm/series/the-ezra-klein-show/how-to-solve-climate-change-and-make-life-more-awesome). Or read his article, [How do we decarbonize?](https://medium.com/otherlab-news/how-do-we-decarbonize-7fc2fa84e887) We don’t need a miracle.

By considering basic human needs of food, clothing, and shelter, we are reimagining the metaphysical environment: the social, economic, and political. How might we build a new economy on a foundation of resilience and symbiosis?\n\nBy creating greater self-awareness, we may recognize how things can go very wrong and create virtual models with predictive power to anticipate problems before they become reality. This is a collaborative project to better understand ourselves and our place in this world, to find generative ways to live with each other and the natural world.​​​​​​​\n\nTranscending human-centered design, this is design that seeks to learn from nature, to put into practice the knowledge and principles of biomimicry to reimagine and redesign our environment, to reconnect ourselves to our own humanity and to reconnect us to the earth and all living things.\n\n[![Resilience Magazine](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49243814197_d1404fd700_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/2i2vqkg)\n\n# Builders Collective\n\nAs a builders collective, our work is to restore the garden, pruning to allow for good fruit to grow.

We instead begin to reflect everything that we see around us.

Design is a proven methodology for applying the scientific method to the process of creativity.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\nJust over 100 years ago, the Bauhaus designed the workshops of the modern age.\n\nAfter a century of building our modern societies, we have discovered several fundamental flaws in these initial prototypes of social organization.\n\nFor example, the nation states that dominate North America are grappling with the legacy of imperial colonization upon which they have been founded. Land appropriation, resource extraction, and the marginalization of Indigenous Peoples that is part of the ongoing genocide are the foundation of the economic, legal, and governance systems.\n\nThe same logic that built these nations are being extended into the logic of market economies that are built for the extraction of value from human resources. These systems are socially, economically, politically, and ecologically unsustainable.\n\nThrough co-creation workshops, it might be possible to explore how we imagine, design, and built the future together by reimagining our social architecture.\n\nDesign is evolving, and people have an opportunity to be part of the evolution that is happening to extend what we have learned about transforming our physical environment to the transformation of our metaphysical world. That which is beyond the physical includes the economic, the social, the political, and the ecological.\n\nHow can we use the proven processes of design to creatively and collaboratively take back power from hierarchies to create change through networks of innovation. If we are going to fundamentally transform our societies for the better, it is going to take all of us working together to replace obsolete models of social organization and governance into a ecologically interdependent, sustainable, and resilient society."},{"url":"/events/","title":"Events","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Events","url":"/events/"}],"content":"\n# Events\n\n## Connecting people to the value of being human\n\nWhen we meet together, we are doing something that is at the foundation of the experience of being human. We are making social connections and building the relationships on which our communities build trust.\n\nIn this age of the nation states that are built on the infrastructure of corporations as the centre for human activity, people have abdicated their power to legal fictions designed by monarchies for wielding power over the labour forces of their empires.\n\nSomehow, we have been deluded into believing that the democracies designed by 18th century aristocrats would be suitable forms of governance for enabling people to achieve some semblance of meaning, purpose, and autonomy in their work lives.\n\n## Balance\n\nWe speak of work-life balance, but we fail to recognize that we have largely outsourced control of our social, economic, and political lives to the market.\n\nWe want tools to help make our lives more manageable, profitable, efficient, convenient, and secure. However, once we have optimized our lives for maximum security, productivity, and satisfaction, will we be able to achieve the fulfillment that we seek?\n\nThe politicians of nation states, the public relations representatives of corporations, and the leaders of our religious institutions are confident that they have the answers for what will make people happy. Why do we trust these authorities, leaders, and influencers? Have they really delivered on the political, brand, and divine promises of a secure and prosperous nation, a materially satisfied life, a peaceful contentedness in moral and spiritual transcendence?\n\nWhat if life is messy? What if life is in process? What if life does not deliver what we expected?\n\n## Design\n\nIt is through the principles of design that we can come to understand that life has limitations, constraints, and frustrations.\n\nWe make tools to solve problems. However, we have created tools at such a scale that the tools we have created have become the problem.\n\nBy coming together to discuss our questions, concerns, frustrations, and problems, we can acknowledge that all is not well. But we do not need to dwell in the sort of media environment that we have created that focuses only on everything that has gone wrong.\n\nDesign is ultimately a creative approach to solving our problems by using the tools we have available to us to research ideas, better understand our problems, think about the possibilities, prototype possible solutions, test and validate whether the prototype is an appropriate and effective solution to the problem, and to build those concepts into reality.\n\nWhat if the value of being human involved influence, agency, and capacity to explore how we can imagine, design, and build the kind of world that we want to live in?\n\nI doubt that we would design what we now have. Let’s challenge the status quo by meeting together to engage in the conversations that we should have been having all along, if politicians, corporations, and religious institutions were not dominating and monopolization public discourse.\n\nWe can rediscover our common humanity by finding common ground in meeting basic human needs and engaging in the process of building a resilient society."},{"url":"/projects/","title":"Projects","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Projects","url":"/projects/"}],"content":"\n# Projects\n\n## Engaging in the design process to solve our greatest challenges\n\n**Projects are for people who are committed to exploring how we imagine, design, and build the future together.

Working together can build the social bonds and networks that help us become stronger, more capable people.\n\nSetting limits and constraints helps us to bring clarity to our motivations and focuses on time, energy, and resources on the most important challenges that we face.\n\nMany of these projects need to be culled and decommissioned, but they continue to exist as records of a long process to discover the ideas that resonate with people.

You just have to follow the process.\n\n- art: desirable (human)\n- science: feasible (technology)\n- business: viable (economics)\n\nhttp://www.designkit.org\n\n### Corporate Culture\n\nEgo is being redefined by corporate culture. We are tribes of consumers who declare membership through consumption, by affiliation to a collection of brands that define one’s personal identity and one’s social circles.\n\n“A corporation is a company or a group of people or an organization authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law.”\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation\n\nBe redefining what it means to be human, we have created a system, designed to value things, that is devaluing humanity.\n\n> In other words, corporations avoid culpability and responsibility in the eyes of the law for crimes against humanity by impersonating humans.\n\nhttps://bigthink.com/gary-shteyngart\n\nhttps://medium.com/@bauhouse/the-value-of-being-human-da8e627a06f6\n\n### Christian Culture\n\nTo reject the Christian narrative is not as easy as changing ideas about what you believe about a sacred text.\n\nLanguage forms us. “We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us.”\n\nJesse James Garrett might say that our perception is interpreted through our cognition, which is evaluated through our emotions, and we respond through our actions.\n\n- perception (senses: stimuli)\n- cognition (mind: thoughts)\n- emotion (heart: feelings)\n- action (body: behaviour)\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/77166651\n\nThrough language, we articulate our conceptions of spirituality, about the human experience of consciousness and self-awareness. Over time, we turn language into art and architecture as a way to express our ideas about how we organize our lives into institutions and social systems.\n\nSo, how do you reject the Christian narrative without rejecting everything that is foundational to the social structures that western society has created over the past 2,000 years?\n\n### The Technology of Language\n\nWords are a technology designed by humans to create shared ideas and experiences. Words are audible sounds that are symbols for ideas that can be shared through vibrations that travel through the air and are decoded by a physical and organic apparatus that relays messages across nerves and synapses to be interpreted through an electrochemical process that results in thoughts within a human brain.\n\nThese thoughts are then processed into the technology of the alphabet and relayed through physical synapses, a digital network called the internet to post into a social media platform.\n\n### Metaphors and Metanarratives\n\nLanguage, vocabulary, syntax and grammar are the tools that we use to create metaphors that allow us to create mental models of reality. Without a metanarrative, how do we understand reality?\n\nWe can only exist at the level of instinct, fixed patterns of behaviour exhibited by organic organisms in response to environmental stimuli.\n\nIf we are to be fully human, we transcend our basic human needs for food, clothing and shelter to reach for transcendence by finding meaning, purpose and belonging through shared experiences. Metanarratives are the tools we need to achieve consensus about how we imagine, design and build our common life together.\n\nIn the design world, we are coming to understand that we are no longer creating physical tools and artifacts. We are designing the human experience.\n\nThe Christian metanarrative is able to dominate the world, because it is a monolithic system that has built the tools, the language, the symbols, the art, the architecture, the institutions, the economic, military, and political machines, and the social identities and structures to wield hierarchical authority over populations.\n\n### Humans Transform Metanarratives into Architecture\n\nMany people are concluding that the Christian edifice that has dominated the world for centuries is crumbling. The Nones and Dones are renouncing affiliation to a monolithic culture that is revealing a structure based on the shifting sands of an authoritarian populism.\n\nHowever, to reject the Christian metanarrative is not as easy as changing ideas about what you believe about a sacred text.\n\nIf we use the metaphor of architecture, we can transform the façade without modifying the structure, but that is a superficial change.\n\nTo start over might mean to destroy the foundations and rebuild from the ground up.\n\nSo, at this point, the renovation project feels overwhelming, because we are resisting the inertia of thousands of years of socialization and the accumulated efforts of humanity to build the existing infrastructure.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/66313792\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/66313792\">The Human Scale</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user8688075\">Autlook Filmsales</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n\nThe Reformation was a change in façade, an iconoclastic effort to destroy the symbols and systems of the medieval age that had corrupted the institution.\n\nModernism rebuilt out of the failure of past traditions to provide peace and security and transformed the façade into a glass curtain wall to expose the exterior forms, interior structures and the human activities accommodated by these spaces.\n\nRecently, we have been observing a loss of faith in all of our institutions: governments, corporations and churches. The institutions are crumbling from the inside out. The façades have fallen away to reveal the human heart, and we are horrified. We are afraid of what we are witnessing in real time.\n\nIt is an apocalypse, an unveiling.\n\nPeople are responding in fear by shutting down, escaping, building walls, and looking for strong leaders to lead them back to a sense of well-being, prosperity and security. Inadvertently, however, they are destroying the institutions and each other in the process.\n\nSo, the question is, are we going to keep building on top of the existing foundation? Do we renovate and construct a new façade over the existing structure? Do we tear it down and rebuild?\n\nCan we reimagine our social architecture?"},{"url":"/process/research-plan/","title":"Research Plan","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"To Build","url":"/process/"},{"title":"Research Plan","url":"/process/research-plan/"}],"content":"\n# UX Research Plan\n\nLast updated on:  \nNovember 14, 2019\n\n**Author:** Stephen Bau  \n**Stakeholders:** Human individuals, communities, societies, Earth and all living things\n\n## Background\n\nWhen do we have permission to think about the big picture?

The focus is on building a community rather than a physical artifact, in keeping with the vision to build leaders to design a resilient society. We start by building the resilience of individuals, developing healthy communities, with the vision of transforming society. The model is to create events to generate awareness and explore the possibilities of human imagination, to run workshops to engage people in participatory design, and to commit to projects to effectively collaborate together to build an inclusive, sustainable, and just way of relating to the living systems that we are a part of.\n\n## Project Background\n\nHow might we think about the big picture of how people can participate in the design of our physical world in a way that recognizes the challenges of living in a metaphysical world of social, economic, and political relationships? In the past, these relationships have had a tendency to devolve into systems of abuse, exploitation, and domination. By recognizing how things can go wrong, we can learn from the wisdom of the past to avoid making the same mistakes, we can imagine new models of social, economic, and political organization to make the present models obsolete, and we can participate in the restoration of the living ecosystems of the earth to create a future of inclusivity, well-being, and justice for the generations to come and for all living things.\n\n## High-Level Design Goals and Objectives\n\n- Build a visual design system, prototype and design experiences, and envision service design opportunities and processes for the builders collective that can work across a variety of media, channels, and touchpoints to invite people to build personal resilience, to build resilient communities, and to build a resilient society.\n- Research the opportunities to build networks of co-creation and collaboration by creating a platform to document what people are learning, how they are connecting, and why they are engaging in the work of social transformation.\n- Launch a platform which may include  a podcast, a magazine, and a website to promote events, workshops, and projects focused on the subject of resilience.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- A prototype for Resilience magazine\n- Websites for Social Architecture, Design Influences, and Builders Collective\n\t- socialarc.com\n\t- designinfluences.com\n\t- builderscollective.com\n- A podcast for the builders collective about resilience\n- An app design for creating habits of resilience, empathy, and harmony: Minimalist Journal\n\n## Brand Message\n\n- BLDRS: Building leaders to design a resilient society\n- Imagine — Social Architecture: Reimagining our common life together.\n- Design — Design influences: Inspired by the past.

The fear was that if you weren’t talented enough to make it as an artist, you would most likely become the stereotypical starving artist. In high school, the education system offered electives to become a commercial artist.\n\nFast forward 40 years, and we might ask, how has design helped to better society?

They purchase political power, and they have made the church merely a political voting block and a willing accomplice in the corporate takeover of the federal government of the American empire.\n\n## Taking Responsibility\n\nAs designers, we must own our part. We who have supported the empire — the government, the corporation and the church — in elevating political, economic and religious values above the value of human beings, either unwittingly or willingly, have been complicit in perpetuating a system of oppression. Taking responsibility is only the first step. We must make reparations.

These pathways of the mind become rivers of actions that empty into large reservoirs of collective social, economic, and political forces that are a deep and systemic ocean of group dynamics.\n\nBecause nation states are legitimized by the monopoly of force over a particular region with arbitrarily set boundaries, the hoarding of resources and territory necessarily lead to behaviours that are aggressive, violent, and oppressive to those who are marginalized by their own internal logic of rules and laws to maintain the social order.

This episode is called [Germania: Architecture in a Fascist Utopia](https://www.curbed.com/2019/5/7/18514684/nice-try-podcast-utopian-avery-trufelman). Traces of this fascist utopia still exist in modern Berlin.*\n\n*This excerpt starts at around 32:50.*\n\nSpeer was handily able to distance himself from an evil system he was not just participating in, but perpetuating. It’s chilling.\n\nIt spells out so clearly that Nazi Germany’s worst atrocities and many atrocities the world over were not only the ideas of singular evil men. They were supported and enacted by systems, by groups of people who woke up in the morning and went to offices to work on it.\n\nWe try to recount these stories in monuments and plaques, as though history is a grandiose series of battles and not something enacted in nine-to-fives.\n\nAnd in the meantime, more buildings go up. Land is moved. A patchwork of monuments and plaques can’t keep up. Because we are all surrounded by so much new development, so many rising towers are transforming the faces of the cities around us.

In the human realm, we are organized around social, economic, and political systems. Yet we are also mammals that are part of the biological diversity of the planet, which is threatened by the immense destructive capability of the human species.\n\nWe have built a social architecture that is actively killing members of our own species while causing the sixth mass extinction of species on this planet. We have built a machine that has formed its own artificial intelligence, and it is actively in the process of killing human beings. Corporations are inventions of aristocratic hierarchies and monarchies to control labour forces to extract resources and make profits. They have assumed legal personhood and now function as overloads over human activity. Humans are no longer in control, since the internal logic of the value of money supersedes the value of human beings.\n\nMoney, also, is a fiction that humans have designed as a medium of exchange. But for love of money, people will exploit other people. Injustice is considered by nation states and corporations as the collateral damage of a system designed for self-perpetuation and self-preservation.\n\nHumans created the perfect killing machine, and people are beginning to rise up to stop it.\n\n## Architecture is ideology made manifest\n\n*A transcript of an excerpt from the excellent Nice Try! podcast about Utopias and how they go wrong. This episode is called [Germania: Architecture in a Fascist Utopia](https://www.curbed.com/2019/5/7/18514684/nice-try-podcast-utopian-avery-trufelman). Traces of this fascist utopia still exist in modern Berlin. This excerpt starts at around 32:50.*\n\nSpeer was handily able to distance himself from an evil system he was not just participating in, but perpetuating. It’s chilling.\n\nIt spells out so clearly that Nazi Germany’s worst atrocities and many atrocities the world over were not only the ideas of singular evil men. They were supported and enacted by systems, by groups of people who woke up in the morning and went to offices to work on it.\n\nWe try to recount these stories in monuments and plaques, as though history is a grandiose series of battles and not something enacted in nine-to-fives.\n\nAnd in the meantime, more buildings go up. Land is moved. A patchwork of monuments and plaques can’t keep up. Because we are all surrounded by so much new development, so many rising towers are transforming the faces of the cities around us. It’s difficult to keep track of all the forces at play, to know who they were built for and who paid for them and which ones intend to do good. Because at the end of the day, all structures are, in some ways, ideology made manifest. They’re so much bigger than any of us.

The phenomenon is a kind of community network of people, an ideology guiding those people, that essentially says, “win-win”: doing well by doing good—maybe even beautiful business—that we can basically live in a world in which we make the world better by the rich and powerful making as much money as possible and certainly never giving up power. That it is possible, in an age of inequality, an age of monopoly, an age of elite capture, that it is somehow magically possible to lift up those prostrated on the floor without somehow disturbing the people standing on their necks. Now, this is a remarkable feat of physics, let alone ideology.\n\nMarket world is billionaires who, to go with something you said earlier, make their money actively by committing harm…\n\n(I believe Facebook, actually, is in that category. Connecting the world is a slogan. It's not an activity.)\n\n…and then do good works on the side to purpose-wash, as you eloquently put it. I believe it's also young people who are not billionaires, who are 22 on college campuses, deciding what to do with their lives. And I start the book with Hilary Cohen's story. She’s one of them—not famous, not a philanthropist, but determined to make a difference, as so many young people are now, and determined to change the world, and who end up at Goldman Sachs and McKinsey because that’s what they’re now told is the way you acquire the skills to change the world. You apprentice with the people most responsible for degrading the conditions of the issue you want to work on.\n\nI believe also there’s a kind of circuit of thought leadership which I write about in the book the kind of Aspen, TED, Davos world where…\n\n“The House of Beautiful Business”\n\nMaybe. I just got here. But I suspect that may be true.\n\n…where there's a lot of good content and a lot of good ideas and there is a certain kind of intellectual boundary, oftentimes, that keeps out the kinds of ideas that people may not like to hear when they've paid two or eight or ten thousand dollars to get some ideas poured down their throat.\n\nAll these things are different. The billionaire is different than the 22 year old is different than the ideas circuit. But what they all have in common is, I believe, an explanation for why we're living in the age we are. Why is Donald Trump president? Why is Brexit happening? Why are the inequality numbers, even in European countries that do have better tax regimes, so bad? the Piketty's numbers on Europe are better than in America, but not great. Why? Why? Why? Right?\n\nI think the defining question I feel from people, when I do events, is like, “Why is this happening?” which is the name of Chris Hayes's podcast, Why is This Happening?\n\nAnd my little answer to why this is happening is we have outsourced the reform—most people agree we need transformational reform of our societies right now—we have outsourced the leadership of such reform to the people with the most to lose from actually changing anything.\n\nI believe in this book is a passionate plea for taking change back from people who deep down have no incentive or desire or willpower to fight for the kinds of structural change that are going to see them be actually less wealthy less powerful and have less impunity.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/pPWhpXRYzNg?t=556"},{"url":"/energy/processes/","title":"Processes","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Energy","url":"/energy/"},{"title":"Processes","url":"/energy/processes/"}],"content":"\n# Processes\n\n## Habits form pathways that are built into networks and centres for activity\n\nHuman activity has fundamentally transformed the environment at such a scale that it is impacting the viability of life on the planet.\n\nThis state of affairs is not sustainable socially, economically, politically, or ecologically. Change is necessary, but the processes that humans have put in place to manage complex needs has exceeded the bounds of rationality. These processes have taken on their own internal logic, driving the commodification of labour, the scarcity of resources, the hoarding of capital, and the competition for dominance.\n\nUnder such circumstances, humans tend to short-circuit rationality by living according to the automatic responses triggered by emotional decision-making. According to cognitive behavioural therapy, we perceive a stimulus, interpret the pattern, and respond accordingly. In an environment of scarcity, people’s behaviours will be motivated primarily by fear, self-preservation, and control.\n\nIf the processes of the system are based on scarcity, the foundational ethics and values will ultimately be self-destructive.\n\nTo change the processes on which the system is based, it is necessary to fundamentally change the conditions of the environment, which will enable the ability to think rationally, engaging the centres of ethical behaviour where the highest values of a society can be nurtured."},{"url":"/imagine/research/","title":"Research","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Imagine","url":"/imagine/"},{"title":"Research","url":"/imagine/research/"}],"content":"# Research\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nStudies and experiments regarding design."},{"url":"/imagine/resources/","title":"Resources","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Imagine","url":"/imagine/"},{"title":"Resources","url":"/imagine/resources/"}],"content":"\n# Resources\n\n## Adapting to Changing Technology\n\nThe tools that we use to communicate have changed over time.
