These are the intangibles that we cannot reduce to measurements.

We wield tools to transform our environment. We have collectively designed global systems of social, economic, and political power by our labour and participation in the ideas, work, and the processes, tools, machines, infrastructure, and architecture that enable these systems and activities.\n\nHowever, after working intensively for the past century, based on a modern idea of progress that values efficiency and productivity as a means of creating continuous and limitless economic growth, we have set in motion systems that are resulting in the destruction of the biological support systems on which our lives and those of so many other creatures depend.\n\n## Slowing Down to Think\n\nGiven the unintended consequences of the social architecture that we have imagined, designed, and built, we recognize that there is a need to slow down to think about the values that are driving our work. We are finding that we have designed our lives in such a way that we are serving our corporations and our machines more than we are serving the needs of humans. We are serving abstract ideas and inanimate objects while destroying life.\n\n## The Design Process\n\nThe process of design has proven to be extremely effective in creating the modern world. We have discovered the tools to radically transform the physical environment. At the same time, we have fundamentally transformed ourselves as human beings, both for good and for ill.\n\nOver the past century, we have focused on building our physical infrastructure, creating a social architecture that has solidified habits of thought, work, and social organization into forms that further entrench patterns of behaviour in social, economic, and political systems that are ultimately self-destructive.\n\nThis is a moment of realization and awareness that is motivating people to respond in anxiety, grief, and anger toward the grave circumstances in which we find ourselves. However, this is not the end of the story. We also have the means and ability to change the way we live. We can recognize the vast opportunities that this world affords and imagine the possibilities, research and define the challenges to be solved, design solutions to meet these needs, and build the kind of future in which we might all want to live.\n\nLet us now focus on the metaphysical—that which is beyond the physical: the social, economic, and political. We tend to lack the language to converse about the metaphysical, since the modern approach to social communication focuses on advertising and marketing to maintain our economic system, and, as a result, tends to create a monopoly on the mode of public and civic discourse.\n\nHowever, the technology of the modern world also gives us the means to shift the focus toward more democratic and equitable modes of conversation and engagement. Our ability to share ideas, resources, and efforts has been amplified by our technologies. We must begin with common values and the common good to redirect our time, energy, and resources into the work of reimagining, redesigning, and rebuilding our social architecture."},{"url":"/time/","title":"Time","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Time","url":"/time/"}],"content":"\n# Time\n\n## Past, Present, and Future\n\nWe remember the past, experience the present, and anticipate the future.

If we perform the same experiment, we should consistently expect the same results.\n\n## Our histories are our collective memory\n\nHow do we know who we are except in community with other people? When we allow our identity to be formed only by those who we consider similar to ourselves, our identity is impoverished by the lack of awareness, knowledge, and wisdom that comes with a lack of diversity in our social relationships.\n\n## Einstein’s Theory of Relativity\n\nIn Einstein’s cosmology, energy is a factor of time and mass. Experience is defined by the three dimensions of space: width, height, and depth. Time adds a fourth dimension, where change can be observed by comparing past, present, and future states of matter. Matter itself is found in three different states, depending on the amount of energy embodied by its elementary particles: solid, liquid, and gas. Atoms are composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons.\n\n- Time, energy, matter\n- Width, height, depth\n- Past, present, future\n- Solid, liquid, gas\n- Protons, neutrons, electrons\n\nThere is a pattern of triads that are found in the many characteristics that we observe in the natural world.

How can we bring these ideas into reality and accomplish these goals and objectives in the real world? Here is where design can help.\n\n## The Power of Imagination\n\nThe big picture thinking that we need to solve the greatest challenges that we are facing at this moment in time.\n\n“There is a terrible misconception in school that when we take art that we are teaching people to draw.

Increasingly, we are exploring ideas about organizational transformation and social change. In other words, we are expanding the scope of design from the physical to the metaphysical: to the social, the economic, and the political. These are issues of connection, capacity, and power.\n\n# Design as a Catalyst for Change\n\n“You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”\n—R. Buckminster Fuller\n\n# The Design Challenge\n\nThe challenge, then, becomes more about how to understand the values, perceptions, and behaviours of the individuals who make up an organization or a society. Through brain research and cognitive science, we are coming to understand that we are not actually rational creatures. Rather we react and behave emotionally and invent rationalizations to justify our instinctive and impulsive actions.\n\nValues, perceptions, narratives, and social identities are far more compelling than data, facts, information, and rational thought in the way that we understand our environment and make decisions as social creatures.\n\n![Diagram of the Bauhaus curriculum](https://d3vjn2zm46gms2.cloudfront.net/blogs/2019/09/18133749/gri_850513_b001_f003_recto_376388ds_1600-1300x873.jpg)\n\n[Diagram of the Bauhaus curriculum](https://blogs.getty.edu/iris/developing-an-inner-feeling-for-materials-with-paper-modeling-at-the-bauhaus/) (adapted, right), 1922, Walter Gropius.

There is an interesting, rather mysterious connection that I have observed between experience and reality. That is, we can conceive of ideas beyond what we sense in the physical environment that are ideals or concepts that can never exist in reality. The ideas are beyond the physical, or metaphysical.\n\nThe other curious characteristic of these ideas is that they occur in groups of three, both in the physical and the metaphysical. Humans have a curious affinity for the rule of thirds, not just in the aesthetics of art, but in all of life.\n\nOn the other hand, there seems to be a relationship between the ideals that we can conceive of and the imperfect realities within which we exist. In that sense, it is possible to conjecture that the physical is a metaphor for the metaphysical, or vice versa.\n\n![Three: progress and the evolution of ideas](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49243812022_3ff2b852ba_b.jpg)\n\n# Mental Models\n\nA mental model is what a person believes about experience and reality.\nIn user experience design, a mental model is what the user believes about the system at hand.\n\nMental models are in flux exactly because they’re embedded in a brain rather than fixed in an external medium. Additional experience with the system can obviously change the model, but users might also update their mental models based on stimuli from elsewhere, such as talking to other users or even applying lessons from other systems.\n\n# Story 1: Collaboration\n\nHow, then, can we begin to map the human experience? How we can design mental habits, social systems, and physical environments for resilience and symbiosis with the living processes and ecology that are the foundation of our biological support systems?\n\nTo better understand our materials as experience designers, we need more holistic mental models of the human experience, as a way to understand what we are designing for.\n\n[![A mental model: builder](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49234429626_7a6763a44b_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/2i1FjCj)\n\n[![A mental model worksheet: builder](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49236449251_1caaf6d94c_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/2i1REZr)\n\n## Unintended Consequences\n\nThe design profession is currently facing a reckoning, similar to the revolutions in our understanding of class, race, gender, and religion. The 1700-year-old project of cultural imperialism that originated with the Roman Emperor Constantine and the integration of church and state finds its realization in the social, political, and economic institutions that have created monolithic monopolies of global power.\n\nThe unintended consequences of the tools that we have designed to shape our environment are the weaponizing of those tools as the means for controlling and manipulating populations, protecting access to scarce resources, and eliminating threats to religious, national, and corporate prosperity and security.\n\n### A healthy economy should be designed to thrive, not grow\n\n<div style=\"max-width:854px\"><div style=\"position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/kate_raworth_a_healthy_economy_should_be_designed_to_thrive_not_grow\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" style=\"position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>\n\n### Kate Raworth argues that rethinking economics can save our planet\n\n<div style=\"max-width:854px\"><div style=\"position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/the_ted_interview_kate_raworth_argues_that_rethinking_economics_can_save_our_planet\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" style=\"position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>\n\n# Story 2: Competition\n\nThe primitive limbic systems in our brains are designed to trigger the fight or flight response as a matter of survival in a world of physical threats. Senses are attuned to dangers in the environment and events perceived as threats will automatically trigger a physical and biological response of increased heart rate, a release of adrenalin, and a heightened state of awareness, along with emotions of anxiety, fear, and panic.\n\nWhen this intellectual, emotional, and physical state of anxiety is prolonged, we call this stress. People who live in this constant state of fear and scarcity will tend to engage in behaviours that are focused on survival and self-preservation. This interpretation of constant threat leads to isolation and aggression, as members of a group engage in a competition for scarce resources and demonstrations of strength and dominance to control the group, protect resources, and destroy enemies. However, such isolation and aggression has a tendency to undermine the survival of the group.\n\n### An Argument for Cooperation Over Competition\n\n<div style=\"max-width:854px\"><div style=\"position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/nick_hanauer_the_dirty_secret_of_capitalism_and_a_new_way_forward\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" style=\"position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>\n\n[![A mental model: nation](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49236656232_0e5406ab4c_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/2i1SJw5)\n\n[![A mental model worksheet: nation](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49235974428_1caaf6d94c_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/2i1PeQQ)\n\n# Metaphysical Design\n\n## Shaping our Social, Economic, and Political Environments\n\nLacking a science that helps us to conceive of a person holistically, it may be possible to draw from the observations of the generations of people who have come before us. They formulated conceptions and philosophies of the world that attempt to communicate the complex, interconnected relationships of human beings to their physical and metaphysical environments. There are things that humans experience that are distinctly tangible, but others that we cannot measure, test, or account for through physical means. Should we simply ignore this data, that which is beyond physical or empirical measurement, or is there something to be gleaned from the musings, conjectures, observations, histories, and literature preserved in ancient sacred texts?\n\n# Story 3: Utopia\n\nAnother mental model acknowledges a common conception of the trinitarian God popularized by the Western Christian colonization of the globe. It represents a mental model of the Creator. The book of Genesis asserts that humans have been made in God’s image. This mental model represents the human mind, heart, and body as a reflection of the trinitarian nature of the Christian conception of the divine as Father, Spirit, and Son. This model captures some common conceptions of the perfection to which humans aspire, but from which we fall short. In many ways, our societies, corporations, and nations are attempts at social, economic, and political utopian visions that fall short of the ideologies and narratives that we have formulated to rationalize our attempts to create a better world.\n\n[![A mental model: creator](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49236656267_bcdfdd1b0d_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/2i1SJwF)\n\n[![A mental model worksheet: creator](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49236449221_6c34e90c05_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/2i1REYV)\n\n# Story 4: Choose Your Own Adventure\n\nBy inviting people to participate in design workshops using these worksheets, we can explore the theme of **design for resilience**.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what is wrong with our existing systems. They are very poorly conceived, designed, and built. However, the blanks in the model actually tell us how much agency we have in this reality. There are a lot of things that are givens, but we have a lot of freedom. Where we lose freedom is in the choices we make collectively. We have designed our own hell in the form of social, economic, and political systems that manifest as physical products, infrastructure, and architecture.\n\nHow might we design a world where we can all live together without killing each other and undermining the life support systems of the planet?\n\nSaul Griffith shares some interesting ideas in his discussion with Ezra Klein: [How to solve climate change and make life more awesome](https://player.fm/series/the-ezra-klein-show/how-to-solve-climate-change-and-make-life-more-awesome).

We use technology to solve problems, but these solutions often have unintended side-effects that result in seemingly intractable problems.\n\nThe concept of resilience begins with an assumption that things break, that things will go wrong, that conflicts and problems will arise. In response to this reality, we need to create ways of proactively addressing issues before they become intractable problems.\n\nSome of the greatest creative movements have coalesced during times of immense cultural shifts and of social, political and economic crisis. As we survey our current situation, we find the social fabric being torn apart and the institutions of government, law, media,  business, and education being threatened by the inability to quickly adapt to the changes that we ourselves are bringing about either intentionally or inadvertently.\n\nWe need people who can lead our society in a different direction, against the inertia of the status quo. This is a different kind of leadership that arises from the recognition that every individual has the ability to offer their time, energy, and resources to the effort.\n\nA century ago, a great war came to an end and people came together to try to rebuild society. It was an opportunity to envision something entirely new, a modern society built on the fusion of art, technology, and industry.

By considering basic human needs of food, clothing, and shelter, they innovated a conception of the modern dwelling: how to build a house. From the hands of millions of workers has arisen the crystal symbol of a new faith, but with the destruction of that concrete, steel and glass symbol, disillusionment has engulfed the world, bringing into question all that has been accomplished.\n\nIt brings to mind an ancient myth about people of one language who came together to build a tower, but their language was confused and the people were scattered across the earth.\n\n## What are we building?\n\nThe question we are asking ourselves is whether all the time, energy, and resources that have been invested has been worth the effort if most of the profit is accumulated by a select few and at the expense of the natural world on which our lives depend.

On the 150th anniversary of the creation of Canada by Queen Victoria's Declaration of Confederation, it is time for Canada to reexamine and reimagine its imperial role throughout the world, from coast to coast, from one continent to another.”\n\nhttps://mitpress.mit.edu/books/extraction-empire\n\n### Mining\n\nMining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth, usually from an ore body, lode, vein, seam, reef or placer deposit. These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.\n\nOres recovered by mining include metals, coal, oil shale, gemstones, limestone, chalk, dimension stone, rock salt, potash, gravel, and clay. Mining is required to obtain any material that cannot be grown through agricultural processes, or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.\n\nMining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times. Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies, analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine, extraction of the desired materials, and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed.\n\nMining operations usually create a negative environmental impact, both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed. Hence, most of the world's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact. Work safety has long been a concern as well, and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines.\n\nLevels of metal recycling are generally low. Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up, some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products. Due to the low recycling rates, some landfills now contain higher concentrations of metal than mines themselves.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining\n\n### Extraction of Petroleum\n\nThe oil and gas extraction workforce face unique health and safety challenges and is recognized by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues. During 2003–2013, the annual rate of occupational fatalities significantly decreased 36.3%; however, the number of work-related fatalities in the U.S. oil and gas extraction industry increased 27.6%, with a total of 1,189 deaths because the size of the workforce grew during this period. Two-thirds of all worker fatalities were attributed to transportation incidents and contact with objects or equipment. More than 50% of persons fatally injured were employed by companies that service wells. Hazard controls include land transportation safety policies and engineering controls such as automated technologies.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraction_of_petroleum\n\n---\n\n## The Canadian Genocide\n\n### Papal Law\n\nCanada, the BC Government, the RCMP, and Coastal GasLink are implementing industrial-scale assimilation by imposing band councils as “electoral democracy” to erase claims of Indigenous Rights and Title to sovereign territory.\n\nhttps://upstanderproject.org/firstlight/doctrine\n\n---\n\n“Canada is violating international laws around military occupation and the rights of Indigenous people.

Land appropriation, resource extraction, and the marginalization of Indigenous Peoples that is part of the ongoing genocide are the foundation of the economic, legal, and governance systems.\n\nThe same logic that built these nations are being extended into the logic of market economies that are built for the extraction of value from human resources. These systems are socially, economically, politically, and ecologically unsustainable.\n\nThrough co-creation workshops, it might be possible to explore how we imagine, design, and built the future together by reimagining our social architecture.\n\nDesign is evolving, and people have an opportunity to be part of the evolution that is happening to extend what we have learned about transforming our physical environment to the transformation of our metaphysical world. That which is beyond the physical includes the economic, the social, the political, and the ecological.\n\nHow can we use the proven processes of design to creatively and collaboratively take back power from hierarchies to create change through networks of innovation. If we are going to fundamentally transform our societies for the better, it is going to take all of us working together to replace obsolete models of social organization and governance into a ecologically interdependent, sustainable, and resilient society."},{"url":"/events/","title":"Events","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Events","url":"/events/"}],"content":"\n# Events\n\n## Connecting people to the value of being human\n\nWhen we meet together, we are doing something that is at the foundation of the experience of being human.

The focus is on building a community rather than a physical artifact, in keeping with the vision to build leaders to design a resilient society. We start by building the resilience of individuals, developing healthy communities, with the vision of transforming society. The model is to create events to generate awareness and explore the possibilities of human imagination, to run workshops to engage people in participatory design, and to commit to projects to effectively collaborate together to build an inclusive, sustainable, and just way of relating to the living systems that we are a part of.\n\n## Project Background\n\nHow might we think about the big picture of how people can participate in the design of our physical world in a way that recognizes the challenges of living in a metaphysical world of social, economic, and political relationships? In the past, these relationships have had a tendency to devolve into systems of abuse, exploitation, and domination. By recognizing how things can go wrong, we can learn from the wisdom of the past to avoid making the same mistakes, we can imagine new models of social, economic, and political organization to make the present models obsolete, and we can participate in the restoration of the living ecosystems of the earth to create a future of inclusivity, well-being, and justice for the generations to come and for all living things.\n\n## High-Level Design Goals and Objectives\n\n- Build a visual design system, prototype and design experiences, and envision service design opportunities and processes for the builders collective that can work across a variety of media, channels, and touchpoints to invite people to build personal resilience, to build resilient communities, and to build a resilient society.\n- Research the opportunities to build networks of co-creation and collaboration by creating a platform to document what people are learning, how they are connecting, and why they are engaging in the work of social transformation.\n- Launch a platform which may include  a podcast, a magazine, and a website to promote events, workshops, and projects focused on the subject of resilience.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- A prototype for Resilience magazine\n- Websites for Social Architecture, Design Influences, and Builders Collective\n\t- socialarc.com\n\t- designinfluences.com\n\t- builderscollective.com\n- A podcast for the builders collective about resilience\n- An app design for creating habits of resilience, empathy, and harmony: Minimalist Journal\n\n## Brand Message\n\n- BLDRS: Building leaders to design a resilient society\n- Imagine — Social Architecture: Reimagining our common life together.\n- Design — Design influences: Inspired by the past.

The news is full of reports of lies, genocide, humanitarian disasters, tragedies, fires, global warming, and sexual assaults.

The illusion of anonymity allows us to test ideas and questions in public. People have permission to ask questions.

They purchase political power, and they have made the church merely a political voting block and a willing accomplice in the corporate takeover of the federal government of the American empire.\n\n## Taking Responsibility\n\nAs designers, we must own our part. We who have supported the empire — the government, the corporation and the church — in elevating political, economic and religious values above the value of human beings, either unwittingly or willingly, have been complicit in perpetuating a system of oppression. Taking responsibility is only the first step. We must make reparations. We do this by redesigning and rebuilding.\n\nIn order to rediscover our own humanity, we are leaving the empire behind.\n\n- [Deconstruction](https://medium.com/@bauhouse/deconstruction-2659da068651)\n\n# The Reconstruction\n\nNow, almost 100 years since the founding of the Bauhaus, we are reconsidering the modernist project.\n\n- [Bauhaus 100](https://www.bauhaus100.com/)\n\n> You never change things by fighting the existing reality.

As graphic designers, we were engaged in a creative process that evolved from pencils, pens, rapidographs and rubylith to fonts, software and hardware to CMYK printing, foil stamping, stochastic screens and paper stocks. The breadth and depth of resources required for competence in the practice of design and communications grows as technology progresses.\n\nDesigners now collaborate with teams of business leaders, entrepreneurs, marketers, researchers, content strategists, and developers to build web applications, and digital products using lean startup principles, agile methodology, behaviour-driven development, and usability testing. We have experienced revolutions from the web standards movement, to the responsive web design movement, to the recognition of design as a primary driver in developing trust and brand recognition as user experience research drives the direction of product design and innovation for businesses.

We are immensely imaginative and creative, yet powerfully violent and destructive.\n\n## A Crisis of Control\n\nWe are eminently aware of our potential to create and destroy, but we have lost our ability to guide and control ourselves. The democratic experiment appears to be falling apart as the appetites for power, wealth, and glory overpower our efforts to bring freedom, equality, and fraternity to humanity.\n\n## Economics\n\nCollectively, we are seeking the sort of leadership that can guide us toward a brighter future. However, the calculations of corporate economics is centralizing wealth and power in the hands of a very few, threatening a darker vision of the future as we descend toward digital despotism. The values and incentives of capitalism have turned against the flourishing of humanity in favour of machines and algorithms that serve to perpetuate corporations. Flesh and blood bodies are being replaced by incorporeal fictions that we have named as legal representatives of human organization. However, these legal entities have turned on their creators. The value of corporations have far exceeded that of their human creators.\n\n## Nations\n\nNation states have legitimized the use of lethal force to perpetrate genocide, steal land, draw borders, and inflame nationalist, religious, and racist animosities toward fellow human beings.\n\n## Faith\n\nAt the heart of our survival as a species is a debate over the faith in capital to order our lives. We have chosen Mammon over our anachronistic notions of God. Yet, we still invoke the names of ancient deities to rationalize our capitalist devotions.\n\n## Arts\n\nThe Bauhaus began in 1919 in Weimar, Germany as a socialist movement to gather architects, artists, and artisans to rebuild society out of the ashes of the war over the domains of nation states and aristocratic empires.\n\n## Politics\n\nWhen, in 1933, the Nazis declared the modernism of the Bauhaus as degenerate art and closed the school, much of the creative diaspora was assimilated into what would become the American capitalist empire. Ever since, designers have tended to be the faithful servants of the capitalist order.\n\n## Technology\n\nDigital communication technologies have disrupted efforts to edit, mediate, control, distort, and suppress the flow of ideas. We find greater freedom to share ideas and to express questions and doubts about how the hierarchical institutions that have tended to dominate our social systems are responsible for oppressive, abusive, violent, and lethal force against large populations of humans and animals, and destructive actions against all forms of vegetative and organic life.\n\n## An Apocalypse and a Reckoning\n\nDividing over gender, race, religion, ideology, and geography has only served to strengthen the control of authoritarian hierarchies.\n\nWith the democratization of communication technologies, the voices of the marginalized, disenfranchised, and disillusioned are finding an audience. The wider access to information has created the conditions for an apocalypse: that is, an unveiling and a revelation of silenced opinions, undisclosed truths, hidden secrets, and suppressed facts. We now face the challenge of a reckoning with the truth of who we are and how we must change.\n\n- Genocide\n- Colonization\n- Slavery\n- War\n- Oppression\n- Patriarchy\n- Racism\n- Theocracy\n\nWe have lost faith in our institutions because they have proven themselves to be untrustworthy.\n\n- The government: institutionalizing injustice\n- The corporation: purchasing power\n- The church: perpetuating abuse\n\n## The Evolution of Design\n\nThe challenge of our century goes far beyond the design of new technologies to solve our problems. We have already spent the past century experimenting with technological inventions to create more efficient and more powerful versions of the old hierarchies. We have only become far more effective at destroying ourselves.\n\nIf Facebook has taught us anything, it is our ability to scale inhumanity at an exponential rate when the metrics for success focus on capital and market dominance rather than human decency.\n\nThe inescapable conclusion about what we need to design for this century is a better way to be human. Can we shift our focus from designing physical artifacts to designing living systems? How do we teach people to be prepared for such a challenge? The old industrial model of education does not serve humanity. It serves the machine.\n\nWe need a new model of education.\n\n## A New Model\n\n> “You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”\n\n― Buckminster Fuller\n\n## What is Design?\n\nDesign is a process that involves the human ability to use experience and memory as inspiration for the imagination to envision, create and build things, relationships, and organizations to solve our problems and manifest abstract ideas as physical artifacts and living systems.\n\n## What is Resilience?\n\nResilience is the awareness of our limitations and the challenges that we face and the ability to recognize our responsibility to engage our perceptions, cognitions, emotions, and actions in the world as creative problem-solvers and agents of change.\n\n## A Design Education\n\nA new model of education must recognize our dependence and connection to a complex ecosystem. We are part of a living system called Earth.\n\n## How Might We Redesign Education for the 21st Century?\n\nA new education model might replace the old model of diplomas, certificates, and degrees. The new credentials would be character, emotional intelligence, experience, wisdom, and resilience. The new curriculum would recognize the complex nature of being human.\n\n### Metaphysics\n\n- Ethics\n- Principles\n- Responsibilities\n\n### Physics\n\n- Influences\n- Technologies\n- Economics\n\n### Biology\n\n- Sensing\n- Interpreting\n- Responding\n\n### Cognition + Emotion\n\n- Philosophy\n- Psychology\n- Sociology\n\n### Perception + Action\n\n- Research\n- Process\n- Systems\n\n## The Work of the People\n\nTo build a new model of society will require all of us to work together.

These pathways of the mind become rivers of actions that empty into large reservoirs of collective social, economic, and political forces that are a deep and systemic ocean of group dynamics.\n\nBecause nation states are legitimized by the monopoly of force over a particular region with arbitrarily set boundaries, the hoarding of resources and territory necessarily lead to behaviours that are aggressive, violent, and oppressive to those who are marginalized by their own internal logic of rules and laws to maintain the social order. Violence is justified to maintain the status quo for those who wield power.\n\n## Architecture as Ideology Made Manifest\n\n*A transcript of an excerpt from the excellent Nice Try! podcast about Utopias and how they go wrong. This episode is called [Germania: Architecture in a Fascist Utopia](https://www.curbed.com/2019/5/7/18514684/nice-try-podcast-utopian-avery-trufelman). Traces of this fascist utopia still exist in modern Berlin.*\n\n*This excerpt starts at around 32:50.*\n\nSpeer was handily able to distance himself from an evil system he was not just participating in, but perpetuating. It’s chilling.\n\nIt spells out so clearly that Nazi Germany’s worst atrocities and many atrocities the world over were not only the ideas of singular evil men. They were supported and enacted by systems, by groups of people who woke up in the morning and went to offices to work on it.\n\nWe try to recount these stories in monuments and plaques, as though history is a grandiose series of battles and not something enacted in nine-to-fives.\n\nAnd in the meantime, more buildings go up. Land is moved. A patchwork of monuments and plaques can’t keep up. Because we are all surrounded by so much new development, so many rising towers are transforming the faces of the cities around us. It’s difficult to keep track of all the forces at play, to know who they were built for and who paid for them and which ones intend to do good. Because at the end of the day, all structures are, in some ways, ideology made manifest. They’re so much bigger than any of us. We just look around and feel so small.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YwZNjbaTxx4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Designing for Humanity\n\nIn contrast, there is greater realization that by designing for people on the margins, we can create better design for everyone.\n\n- [Designing for Humanity](https://www.sypartners.com/podcasts/designing-for-humanity/)"},{"url":"/energy/principles/","title":"Principles","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Energy","url":"/energy/"},{"title":"Principles","url":"/energy/principles/"}],"content":"\n# Principles\n\n## The logic of market world: doing well by doing good\n\n*A transcript of Anand Giridharadas in conversation with Léa Steinacker at the House of Beautiful Business 2019.*\n\nI coined this term “market world” to try to describe a bunch of things that are disparate phenomena that I think are part of the same phenomenon. The phenomenon is a kind of community network of people, an ideology guiding those people, that essentially says, “win-win”: doing well by doing good—maybe even beautiful business—that we can basically live in a world in which we make the world better by the rich and powerful making as much money as possible and certainly never giving up power. That it is possible, in an age of inequality, an age of monopoly, an age of elite capture, that it is somehow magically possible to lift up those prostrated on the floor without somehow disturbing the people standing on their necks. Now, this is a remarkable feat of physics, let alone ideology.\n\nMarket world is billionaires who, to go with something you said earlier, make their money actively by committing harm…\n\n(I believe Facebook, actually, is in that category. Connecting the world is a slogan. It's not an activity.)\n\n…and then do good works on the side to purpose-wash, as you eloquently put it. I believe it's also young people who are not billionaires, who are 22 on college campuses, deciding what to do with their lives. And I start the book with Hilary Cohen's story. She’s one of them—not famous, not a philanthropist, but determined to make a difference, as so many young people are now, and determined to change the world, and who end up at Goldman Sachs and McKinsey because that’s what they’re now told is the way you acquire the skills to change the world. You apprentice with the people most responsible for degrading the conditions of the issue you want to work on.\n\nI believe also there’s a kind of circuit of thought leadership which I write about in the book the kind of Aspen, TED, Davos world where…\n\n“The House of Beautiful Business”\n\nMaybe. I just got here. But I suspect that may be true.\n\n…where there's a lot of good content and a lot of good ideas and there is a certain kind of intellectual boundary, oftentimes, that keeps out the kinds of ideas that people may not like to hear when they've paid two or eight or ten thousand dollars to get some ideas poured down their throat.\n\nAll these things are different. The billionaire is different than the 22 year old is different than the ideas circuit. But what they all have in common is, I believe, an explanation for why we're living in the age we are. Why is Donald Trump president? Why is Brexit happening? Why are the inequality numbers, even in European countries that do have better tax regimes, so bad? the Piketty's numbers on Europe are better than in America, but not great. Why? Why? Why? Right?\n\nI think the defining question I feel from people, when I do events, is like, “Why is this happening?” which is the name of Chris Hayes's podcast, Why is This Happening?\n\nAnd my little answer to why this is happening is we have outsourced the reform—most people agree we need transformational reform of our societies right now—we have outsourced the leadership of such reform to the people with the most to lose from actually changing anything.\n\nI believe in this book is a passionate plea for taking change back from people who deep down have no incentive or desire or willpower to fight for the kinds of structural change that are going to see them be actually less wealthy less powerful and have less impunity.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/pPWhpXRYzNg?t=556"},{"url":"/imagine/research/","title":"Research","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Imagine","url":"/imagine/"},{"title":"Research","url":"/imagine/research/"}],"content":"\n# Research\n\n## Methods for observation, information gathering, and testing\n\nThe theory and practice of design is evolving as technology changes and organizations adapt to a dynamic social, economic, political, and ecological environment.\n\nThe role of the designer has been facing constant change as media and technology provide capabilities that had not been possible are quickly adopted by people who are trying to integrate the needs of people and business within the constraints of what is technically feasible.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nStudies and experiments regarding design."},{"url":"/energy/ethics/","title":"Ethics","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Energy","url":"/energy/"},{"title":"Ethics","url":"/energy/ethics/"}],"content":"\n# Ethics\n\n## The world is in crisis as its core values are found to be bankrupt\n\n### Canada’s Reckoning\n\n“While your government did initially show remarkable restraint, you have of course in the end given a nod to enforcement action, which is now being pursued by national, provincial and municipal police forces across the country.

If everything feels backward, we need a way forward. If maintaining the current course of action leads inevitably to our imminent demise, we need to change course.\n\nThe problem is that when we face a crisis, it is natural to respond autonomically, using the typical modes of survival that our species has evolved as an automatic self-defence system. The limbic system is often referred to as the “lizard brain.” The brain is wired for the simplest of responses to environmental stimuli. Because English-speaking humans have an affinity for alliteration, we like to categorize these [responses](https://www.anxietycanada.com/articles/fight-flight-freeze/) with similar initial consonants: fight, flight, freeze, or fake. To this collection, [others](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/where-addiction-meets-your-brain/201404/your-lizard-brain) add fear, feeding, and fornication.\n\nWhen we fear for our very survival, we tend to make impulsive, irrational decisions. These are survival strategies, but they’re not always helpful courses of action.\n\n- Stimulus : Response\n\nTaking time to think and engage the rational mind helps us to short-circuit the initial impulse to react in aggression, run and hide from problems, become paralyzed by overwhelming complexity, or deny that anything is wrong.\n\n- Stimulus : Interpretation : Response\n\nIn public relations, the strategy for dealing with a crisis has been to have a plan in place that anticipates the best course of action, should anything go wrong. Murphy’s law guides this sort of approach, beginning with the certainty that, if anything can go wrong, it will go wrong.\n\nIn public relations, the strategy for dealing with a crisis has been to have a plan in place that anticipates the best course of action, should anything go wrong. Murphy’s law guides this sort of approach, beginning with the certainty that, if anything can go wrong, it will go wrong.\n\nThe concept of resilience also begins with this premise. If there is any possibility of bouncing back after a crisis, it will be because there were strategies in place for dealing with problems that might seem otherwise unmanageable.\n\n> “Anything that’s human is mentionable, and anything that is mentionable can be more manageable. When we can talk about our feelings, they become less overwhelming, less upsetting, and less scary. The people we trust with that important talk can help us know that we are not alone.”\n\n— [Mister Rogers](https://bookriot.com/2018/08/02/mister-rogers-quotes/)\n\nThe foundation of resilience is a good social support system. In other words, people need community. Humans have survived as a species, not because we are dominant, competitive, aggressive, and lethal, but because we are empathetic, cooperative, compassionate, and caring.\n\n## The Precariat\n\nEducation may not necessarily be the panacea that we had hoped it might be. There is nothing more dangerous than a well-educated psychopath. Unfortunately, there is a strong correlation between [billionaires](https://www.fastcompany.com/90411598/how-anand-giridharadas-disrupted-the-cult-of-the-billionaire), [CEOs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackmccullough/2019/12/09/the-psychopathic-ceo/), and [psychopaths](https://www.businessinsider.com/here-are-the-7-distinct-traits-many-rich-people-have-in-common-with-psychopaths-2015-3).\n\nAt the root of the psychopath’s approach to success is a story about scarcity, fear, and competition. If this story dominates the thinking of a leader or an [organization](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/554240/temp-by-louis-hyman/9780735224087), it will naturally manifest in the social architecture built by that leader or organization. In fact, this is to be expected from the orientation of the capitalist, market-driven economic system of nation states that were founded by monarchical imperial colonialism. At the root of the system is a motivation that is primarily genocidal. The past 500 years of “Western Civilization” have borne out this hypothesis in a history of endless wars, destruction, and genocide.\n\n> The untold history of the surprising origins of the \"gig economy\"—how deliberate decisions made by consultants and CEOs in the 50s and 60s upended the stability of the workplace and the lives of millions of working men and women in postwar America.\n>\n> Over the last fifty years, job security has cratered as the institutions that insulated us from volatility have been swept aside by a fervent belief in the market. Now every working person in America today asks the same question: how secure is my job? In Temp, Louis Hyman explains how we got to this precarious position and traces the real origins of the gig economy: it was created not by accident, but by choice through a series of deliberate decisions by consultants and CEOs—long before the digital revolution.\n>\n> Uber is not the cause of insecurity and inequality in our country, and neither is the rest of the gig economy.

They called it wetiko, a delusional belief that cannibalizing the life force of others is a logical and morally upright way to live. The Native Americans believed that wetiko derived from people’s inability to see themselves as enmeshed, interdependent parts of the natural environment.” @rushkoff\n\nhttps://twitter.com/bauhouse/status/1214924713396301825?s=20\n\n> Team Human is a manifesto—a fiery distillation of preeminent digital theorist Douglas Rushkoff’s most urgent thoughts on civilization and human nature. In one hundred lean and incisive statements, he argues that we are essentially social creatures, and that we achieve our greatest aspirations when we work together—not as individuals. Yet today society is threatened by a vast antihuman infrastructure that undermines our ability to connect. Money, once a means of exchange, is now a means of exploitation; education, conceived as way to elevate the working class, has become another assembly line; and the internet has only further divided us into increasingly atomized and radicalized groups.\n>\n> Team Human delivers a call to arms. If we are to resist and survive these destructive forces, we must recognize that being human is a team sport. In Rushkoff’s own words: “Being social may be the whole point.” Harnessing wide-ranging research on human evolution, biology, and psychology, Rushkoff shows that when we work together we realize greater happiness, productivity, and peace. If we can find the others who understand this fundamental truth and reassert our humanity—together—we can make the world a better place to be human.\n\n- [Team Human](https://books.wwnorton.com/books/9780393651690) by Douglas Rushkoff\n\n### Columbus and Other Cannibals\n\n> Celebrated American Indian thinker Jack D.

His history of terrorism, genocide, and ecocide told from a Native American point of view has inspired America’s most influential activists for decades. Frighteningly, his radical critique of the modern “civilized” lifestyle is more relevant now than ever before.\n>\n> Identifying the Western compulsion to consume the earth as a sickness, Forbes writes:\n>\n> “Brutality knows no boundaries. Greed knows no limits. Perversion knows no borders. . . . These characteristics all push towards an extreme, always moving forward once the initial infection sets in. . . . This is the disease of the consuming of other creatures’ lives and possessions. I call it cannibalism.”\n>\n> This updated edition includes a new chapter by the author.\n\n- [Columbus and Other Cannibals: The Wetiko Disease of Exploitation, Imperialism, and Terrorism](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/214073/columbus-and-other-cannibals-by-jack-d-forbes-foreword-by-derrick-jensen/) by Jack D. Forbes\n\n## A Shift in Values\n\nTo change the system that has been architected by a particularly self-destructive strategy of survival is to fundamentally shift the values at the foundation of its motivations and behaviours.\n\nWe must understand our values before we can change them. Our behaviours are a clue. Self-awareness is something that does not come naturally, especially when we take this modern, artificial, constructed reality as normal. It is not normal. It has been built upon 500 years of colonial genocide, and that legacy doesn’t just go away. We actually have to recognize that legacy and confront it.\n\nAt the centre of this strategy is the relationship that we have to Indigenous Peoples, in our own country, and around the globe. These relationships are interconnected. We need to look at all the designed objects that we use every day and begin to deconstruct their meaning in our decontextualized lives, to reconnect to the people, the cultures, the landscapes, and the ecosystems that have been disrupted because of our desire, acquisition, and use of these products."},{"url":"/design/ethics/","title":"Ethics","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Design","url":"/design/"},{"title":"Ethics","url":"/design/ethics/"}],"content":"# Ethics"},{"url":"/design/principles/","title":"Principles","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Design","url":"/design/"},{"title":"Principles","url":"/design/principles/"}],"content":"# Principles"},{"url":"/energy/processes/","title":"Processes","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Energy","url":"/energy/"},{"title":"Processes","url":"/energy/processes/"}],"content":"\n# Processes\n\n## Habits form pathways that are built into networks and centres for activity\n\nHuman activity has fundamentally transformed the environment at such a scale that it is impacting the viability of life on the planet.\n\nThis state of affairs is not sustainable socially, economically, politically, or ecologically. Change is necessary, but the processes that humans have put in place to manage complex needs has exceeded the bounds of rationality. These processes have taken on their own internal logic, driving the commodification of labour, the scarcity of resources, the hoarding of capital, and the competition for dominance.\n\nUnder such circumstances, humans tend to short-circuit rationality by living according to the automatic responses triggered by emotional decision-making. According to cognitive behavioural therapy, we perceive a stimulus, interpret the pattern, and respond accordingly. In an environment of scarcity, people’s behaviours will be motivated primarily by fear, self-preservation, and control.\n\nIf the processes of the system are based on scarcity, the foundational ethics and values will ultimately be self-destructive.\n\nTo change the processes on which the system is based, it is necessary to fundamentally change the conditions of the environment, which will enable the ability to think rationally, engaging the centres of ethical behaviour where the highest values of a society can be nurtured."},{"url":"/energy/systems/","title":"Systems","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Energy","url":"/energy/"},{"title":"Systems","url":"/energy/systems/"}],"content":"\n# Systems\n\n## Recognizing complexity and interdependence in human existence\n\nSystems thinking recognizes the complexity of the environment we inhabit. In the human realm, we are organized around social, economic, and political systems. Yet we are also mammals that are part of the biological diversity of the planet, which is threatened by the immense destructive capability of the human species.\n\nWe have built a social architecture that is actively killing members of our own species while causing the sixth mass extinction of species on this planet. We have built a machine that has formed its own artificial intelligence, and it is actively in the process of killing human beings. Corporations are inventions of aristocratic hierarchies and monarchies to control labour forces to extract resources and make profits. They have assumed legal personhood and now function as overloads over human activity. Humans are no longer in control, since the internal logic of the value of money supersedes the value of human beings.\n\nMoney, also, is a fiction that humans have designed as a medium of exchange. But for love of money, people will exploit other people. Injustice is considered by nation states and corporations as the collateral damage of a system designed for self-perpetuation and self-preservation.\n\nHumans created the perfect killing machine, and people are beginning to rise up to stop it.\n\n## Architecture is ideology made manifest\n\n*A transcript of an excerpt from the excellent Nice Try! podcast about Utopias and how they go wrong. This episode is called [Germania: Architecture in a Fascist Utopia](https://www.curbed.com/2019/5/7/18514684/nice-try-podcast-utopian-avery-trufelman). Traces of this fascist utopia still exist in modern Berlin. This excerpt starts at around 32:50.*\n\nSpeer was handily able to distance himself from an evil system he was not just participating in, but perpetuating. It’s chilling.\n\nIt spells out so clearly that Nazi Germany’s worst atrocities and many atrocities the world over were not only the ideas of singular evil men. They were supported and enacted by systems, by groups of people who woke up in the morning and went to offices to work on it.\n\nWe try to recount these stories in monuments and plaques, as though history is a grandiose series of battles and not something enacted in nine-to-fives.\n\nAnd in the meantime, more buildings go up. Land is moved. A patchwork of monuments and plaques can’t keep up. Because we are all surrounded by so much new development, so many rising towers are transforming the faces of the cities around us. It’s difficult to keep track of all the forces at play, to know who they were built for and who paid for them and which ones intend to do good. Because at the end of the day, all structures are, in some ways, ideology made manifest. They’re so much bigger than any of us. We just look around and feel so small.\n\n— Avery Trufelman"},{"url":"/design/systems/","title":"Systems","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Design","url":"/design/"},{"title":"Systems","url":"/design/systems/"}],"content":"# Systems"},{"url":"/resources/people/","title":"People","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Resources","url":"/resources/"},{"title":"People","url":"/resources/people/"}],"content":"\n# People\n\n## Humans are a commodity and a resource from which to extract value\n\nThe subjects of the Crown are valued according to their ability to extract value from other subjects.\n\nPeople are a commodity with little actual value, especially in terms of materials.

If the story of this world is founded upon the scarcity of resources and the competition with other empires to secure the largest share of the available resources as a means of survival, there will be a strong motivation to eliminate any possible threats to global dominance. Consequently, the Indigenous Peoples of the world would be considered, at best, an impediment to world domination. A bureaucratic machinery would be sanctioned by Royal Proclamation to claim any poorly defended territories by first issuing a law that states in legal prose the ownership of said lands has been judiciously appointed to the Crown.\n\nAny objections should be taken up by potential litigants with letters of courteous civil discourse with the appointed ministers of the Crown who have been charged with the dispensation of the rules and judgments of the Royal Proclamations.\n\nWith the dissolution of the Monarchy, in practice, if not in legal governance or by public acclaim, the Rights and Title of the land appropriated by Royal Proclamation should instead be entrusted to those who have the largest amounts of the currency issued by the Monarch, whose image has been so represented upon said currency. As corporations have been granted legal personhood, it is least likely that any single individual is able to amass monetary value, real estate, and other forms of property and assets as efficiently as an entity that has been designed to scale such efforts to industrial levels of resource extraction, whether the commodity is vegetable, mineral, or animal. Similar logic may be applied to human resources, as commodification renders them as expendable liabilities on a balance sheet.\n\nAll relationships should be considered in relation to the hierarchy established by the Crown, according to the valuation that must be applied with regard to one’s station, position, or class. The population should henceforth be educated in such a way as to understand one’s station only with respect to the time that can be reasonably expected to maintain the status quo, upon which the edifice of amusements is precariously established. The house of cards must not be revealed as such. Through the duties of public relations managers, the reputation of the Crown and the Nation will be polished clean of any surreptitious motivations of the subjugation of the royal subjects. Henceforth, the Prime Ministers and Premiers of the Royal Dominion shall obfuscate the true intentions of the Crown, who will fulfill the duties of the head of state as a distraction to the actual dominance of the aristocratic rulers, who have been reframed and fashioned as entrepreneurial leaders and business executives and philanthropic celebrities to whom unquestioning allegiance are afforded by a media establishment that trains the population to regard such affairs as of paramount importance."},{"url":"/design/processes/","title":"Processes","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Design","url":"/design/"},{"title":"Processes","url":"/design/processes/"}],"content":"# Processes"},{"url":"/build/relationships/","title":"Relationships","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Build","url":"/build/"},{"title":"Relationships","url":"/build/relationships/"}],"content":"# Relationships"},{"url":"/resources/social-architecture/","title":"Social Architecture","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Resources","url":"/resources/"},{"title":"Social Architecture","url":"/resources/social-architecture/"}],"content":"\n# Social Architecture\n\n## The nation state has been built by the powerful to maintain the status quo\n\nIn Canada, we have three major institutions:\n\n- The Crown\n- The Corporation\n- The Church\n\nOur society is built on extracting resources on behalf of the Crown, the corporation, and the church from people who we are supposed to consider as others in a competition for scarce resources, whether it is land, oil, money, or access to a fictionalized afterlife.\n\nWe don’t have permission from our institutions to use our time to enjoy human community for the sake of its own pleasure of sharing a table, sharing a meal, and sharing conversation.\n\nBy creating the conditions to render difference as suspect and as a form of sedition against the state and a form of apostasy against the orthodoxy of the market economy, the activities that would normally be considered as the means of building authentic relationships, supportive networks, and interdependent social organizations is discouraged and often criminalized as a threat to the social order.\n\n## Permission to be curious\n\nWhat if people were given permission to be curious?

It is known as design thinking or human-centred design. IDEO is the company that has been most successful as a design institution and are the evangelists of this new religion. They believe that integration of art, science and commerce can save humanity. You just have to follow the process.\n\n- art: desirable (human)\n- science: feasible (technology)\n- business: viable (economics)\n\nhttp://www.designkit.org\n\n### Corporate Culture\n\nEgo is being redefined by corporate culture. We are tribes of consumers who declare membership through consumption, by affiliation to a collection of brands that define one’s personal identity and one’s social circles.\n\n“A corporation is a company or a group of people or an organization authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law.”\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation\n\nBe redefining what it means to be human, we have created a system, designed to value things, that is devaluing humanity.\n\n> In other words, corporations avoid culpability and responsibility in the eyes of the law for crimes against humanity by impersonating humans.\n\nhttps://bigthink.com/gary-shteyngart\n\nhttps://medium.com/@bauhouse/the-value-of-being-human-da8e627a06f6\n\n### Christian Culture\n\nTo reject the Christian narrative is not as easy as changing ideas about what you believe about a sacred text.\n\nLanguage forms us. “We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us.”\n\nJesse James Garrett might say that our perception is interpreted through our cognition, which is evaluated through our emotions, and we respond through our actions.\n\n- perception (senses: stimuli)\n- cognition (mind: thoughts)\n- emotion (heart: feelings)\n- action (body: behaviour)\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/77166651\n\nThrough language, we articulate our conceptions of spirituality, about the human experience of consciousness and self-awareness. Over time, we turn language into art and architecture as a way to express our ideas about how we organize our lives into institutions and social systems.\n\nSo, how do you reject the Christian narrative without rejecting everything that is foundational to the social structures that western society has created over the past 2,000 years?\n\n### The Technology of Language\n\nWords are a technology designed by humans to create shared ideas and experiences. Words are audible sounds that are symbols for ideas that can be shared through vibrations that travel through the air and are decoded by a physical and organic apparatus that relays messages across nerves and synapses to be interpreted through an electrochemical process that results in thoughts within a human brain.\n\nThese thoughts are then processed into the technology of the alphabet and relayed through physical synapses, a digital network called the internet to post into a social media platform.\n\n### Metaphors and Metanarratives\n\nLanguage, vocabulary, syntax and grammar are the tools that we use to create metaphors that allow us to create mental models of reality. Without a metanarrative, how do we understand reality?\n\nWe can only exist at the level of instinct, fixed patterns of behaviour exhibited by organic organisms in response to environmental stimuli.\n\nIf we are to be fully human, we transcend our basic human needs for food, clothing and shelter to reach for transcendence by finding meaning, purpose and belonging through shared experiences. Metanarratives are the tools we need to achieve consensus about how we imagine, design and build our common life together.\n\nIn the design world, we are coming to understand that we are no longer creating physical tools and artifacts. We are designing the human experience.\n\nThe Christian metanarrative is able to dominate the world, because it is a monolithic system that has built the tools, the language, the symbols, the art, the architecture, the institutions, the economic, military, and political machines, and the social identities and structures to wield hierarchical authority over populations.\n\n### Humans Transform Metanarratives into Architecture\n\nMany people are concluding that the Christian edifice that has dominated the world for centuries is crumbling. The Nones and Dones are renouncing affiliation to a monolithic culture that is revealing a structure based on the shifting sands of an authoritarian populism.\n\nHowever, to reject the Christian metanarrative is not as easy as changing ideas about what you believe about a sacred text.\n\nIf we use the metaphor of architecture, we can transform the façade without modifying the structure, but that is a superficial change.\n\nTo start over might mean to destroy the foundations and rebuild from the ground up.\n\nSo, at this point, the renovation project feels overwhelming, because we are resisting the inertia of thousands of years of socialization and the accumulated efforts of humanity to build the existing infrastructure.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/66313792\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/66313792\">The Human Scale</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user8688075\">Autlook Filmsales</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n\nThe Reformation was a change in façade, an iconoclastic effort to destroy the symbols and systems of the medieval age that had corrupted the institution.\n\nModernism rebuilt out of the failure of past traditions to provide peace and security and transformed the façade into a glass curtain wall to expose the exterior forms, interior structures and the human activities accommodated by these spaces.\n\nRecently, we have been observing a loss of faith in all of our institutions: governments, corporations and churches. The institutions are crumbling from the inside out. The façades have fallen away to reveal the human heart, and we are horrified. We are afraid of what we are witnessing in real time.\n\nIt is an apocalypse, an unveiling.\n\nPeople are responding in fear by shutting down, escaping, building walls, and looking for strong leaders to lead them back to a sense of well-being, prosperity and security. Inadvertently, however, they are destroying the institutions and each other in the process.\n\nSo, the question is, are we going to keep building on top of the existing foundation? Do we renovate and construct a new façade over the existing structure? Do we tear it down and rebuild?\n\nCan we reimagine our social architecture?"},{"url":"/build/social-architecture/","title":"Social Architecture","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Build","url":"/build/"},{"title":"Social Architecture","url":"/build/social-architecture/"}],"content":"# Social Architecture"},{"url":"/build/community/","title":"Community","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Build","url":"/build/"},{"title":"Community","url":"/build/community/"}],"content":"# Community"},{"url":"/imagine/resources/books/","title":"Books","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Imagine","url":"/imagine/"},{"title":"Resources","url":"/imagine/resources/"},{"title":"Books","url":"/imagine/resources/books/"}],"content":"\n# Books\n\nThinking deeply about the theory and practice of creative collaboration."},{"url":"/imagine/resources/articles/","title":"Articles","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Imagine","url":"/imagine/"},{"title":"Resources","url":"/imagine/resources/"},{"title":"Articles","url":"/imagine/resources/articles/"}],"content":"\n# Articles\n\nSharing what we are learning to help build a better future."},{"url":"/imagine/resources/organizations/","title":"Organizations","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Imagine","url":"/imagine/"},{"title":"Resources","url":"/imagine/resources/"},{"title":"Organizations","url":"/imagine/resources/organizations/"}],"content":"\n# Organizations\n\nMaking connections, nurturing relationships, and working together."},{"url":"/imagine/resources/podcasts/","title":"Podcasts","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Imagine","url":"/imagine/"},{"title":"Resources","url":"/imagine/resources/"},{"title":"Podcasts","url":"/imagine/resources/podcasts/"}],"content":"\n# Podcasts\n\nThe democratization of digital media and engaging in imaginative dialogue."},{"url":"/imagine/resources/sites/","title":"Sites","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Imagine","url":"/imagine/"},{"title":"Resources","url":"/imagine/resources/"},{"title":"Sites","url":"/imagine/resources/sites/"}],"content":"\n# Sites\n\nCommunicating broadly and engaging in public discourse to share ideas."},{"url":"/imagine/resources/videos/","title":"Videos","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Builders Collective","url":"/"},{"title":"Imagine","url":"/imagine/"},{"title":"Resources","url":"/imagine/resources/"},{"title":"Videos","url":"/imagine/resources/videos/"}],"content":"\n# Videos\n\nLearning by doing and finding ways to put ideas into action."}]
